This is needed for developing for N8 in QtCreator 2.0.0:
1. Download and install Nokia Ovi Suite
   this makes QtCreator detect the phone
2. Download and install TRK (s60_tb_9_2_app_trk_3_2_7.sisx) on the N8 from [1]
   this allows deployment and debugging from within QtCreator
3. Download and install QtCreator from [2]
--> Finished :)

Problem: No Bluetooth (local-connectivity-api) so far. This feature is planned
for second half of 2010 [3].


Solution: Install a Standalone SDK and Qt on top of it as described on
http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Using_Qt_with_Standalone_SDKs

Additionally, rebuild the Qt for gcce as described on
http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?163579-qtmain.lib-not-found&p=734233#post734233

Furthermore, rebuild the QtMobility package for gcce by running
configure
make debug-winscw
make debug-gcce
in the QtMobility directory.
