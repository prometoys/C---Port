So this is what you need to do (adopted from [1]):
OK 1. Download and install Nokia Ovi Suite from [2]
    this makes QtCreator detect the phone
NO 2. Download and install ActivePerl 5.8.x from [3]
NO 3. Download and install the S60 Symbian^3 SDK 0.8 from [4]
   this is newer than 5th edition and for the N8
   when asked whether to install the ARM toolchain, choose yes
NO 4. Download and install Open C / C++ from [5]
   XXX does not work, searches for S60 SDK 3rd edition
OK 5. Download and install TRK (s60_tb_9_2_app_trk_3_2_7.sisx) on the N8 from [6]
NO 6. Download and install the Qt Symbian Libraries from [7]
OK 7. Download QtCreator and install

NO 8. In Projects settings, choose the Nokia Symbian_3 SDK and enter the CSL/GCCE
   path in its "Verwaltung" dialog
